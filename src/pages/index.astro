      <p>
        Hey there, I'm a hobbyist developer and designer with love for
        minimalist design and meaningful experience. Currently fixing bugs at my
        workplace, where I‚Äôm actively involved in frontend development using
        frameworks like ReactJs, NuxtJs and React Native. In my free time I love
        building side projects and exploring new technologies. For most of my
        design work, I use Figma and Photopea. Apart from coding, I love to
        sleep, read and explore all new interesting stuff going around the world
        so as to keep myself up to date.
      </p>
