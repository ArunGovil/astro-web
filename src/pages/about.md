Hey there, I'm a hobbyist developer and designer with love for
minimalist design and meaningful experience. Currently fixing bugs at my
workplace, where Iâ€™m actively involved in frontend development using
frameworks like ReactJs, NuxtJs and React Native. In my free time I love
building side projects and exploring new technologies. For most of my
design work, I use Figma and Photopea. Apart from coding, I love to
sleep, read and explore all new interesting stuff going around the world
so as to keep myself up to date.
